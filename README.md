## Key Features
- **Data Acquisition:** Utilizes Yahoo Finance API to gather historical cryptocurrency data.
- **Data Exploration:** Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implements scaling, moving averages, and feature engineering for model readiness.
- **Model Development:** Constructs LSTM and ARIMA models with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualizations to assess performance.



## Usage

Run the main script to execute the model training and predictions:
python main.py

## Data Sources
Historical Bitcoin data sourced from Yahoo Finance.
## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Visual comparisons of predicted vs. actual prices.
